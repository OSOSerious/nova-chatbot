Sentiment Analysis Project Overview
This project is a simple sentiment analysis tool that uses a logistic regression model to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter that allows users to enter text, analyze its sentiment, and save or load text files.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Enter text into the GUI and click the "Analyze Sentiment" button to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
Save Text: Save the text in the GUI to a file using the "Save Text" button.
Load Text: Load text from a file into the GUI using the "Load Text" button.
Clear Text: Clear the text in the GUI and the result label using the "Clear Text" button.
Requirements
Python: This project requires Python 3.8 or later to run.
Tkinter: This project uses Tkinter for the GUI, which is included with Python.
NLTK: This project uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and tokenization. You can install NLTK using pip: pip install nltk
Scikit-learn: This project uses scikit-learn for the logistic regression model. You can install scikit-learn using pip: pip install scikit-learn
