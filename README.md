[# Sentiment Analysis for Beginners

## What is this?

This is a simple computer program that can tell if a sentence is happy, sad, or neutral. It's like having a robot friend who can understand emotions in text!

## What can it do?

- It can read sentences
- It can decide if a sentence is positive, negative, or neutral
- It's pretty good at guessing the mood of a sentence

## What do I need?

- A computer
- Python (it's a type of computer language)
- Some extra tools that help Python understand language better

## How do I set it up?

1. Make sure you have Python on your computer. If you don't, ask a tech-savvy friend to help you install it.

2. Open a program called "Command Prompt" (on Windows) or "Terminal" (on Mac).

3. Type these magic words and press Enter after each:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
   ```

4. Now, open Python and type these magic words:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

## How do I use it?

1. Put the `sentiment_analysis.py` file on your computer.

2. Open Command Prompt or Terminal again.

3. Go to where you put the file (you might need to ask for help with this).

4. Type this and press Enter:
   ```
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

5. The program will show you how well it guesses emotions and will try to guess the emotion of a test sentence.

## Can I change it?

Yes! If you're feeling brave, you can open the `sentiment_analysis.py` file with a text editor and change things. But be careful - it's easy to break things if you're not sure what you're doing.
